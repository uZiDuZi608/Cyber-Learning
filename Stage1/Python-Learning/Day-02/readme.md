# Day 02 - Data Types and Number Operations

## 📚 Concepts Covered
- Primitive data types (int, float, string)
- Type checking using `type()`
- Type errors
- Type conversion (int(), float())
- Mathematical operators (+, -, *, /)
- Number manipulation
- f-strings formatting

## 🛠 Mini Project
**Tip Calculator**

This program:
1. Takes the total bill amount
2. Asks the user for the tip percentage
3. Asks how many people are splitting the bill
4. Calculates how much each person should pay

## 💡 Key Takeaway
Understanding data types and type conversion is essential for performing mathematical calculations correctly in Python.
